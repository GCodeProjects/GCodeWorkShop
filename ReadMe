Source code of EdytorNC can be downloaded from SVN server on sourceforge.net (http://sourceforge.net/p/edytornc/code/HEAD/tree/)


Some features :
    *   Bolt holes calculation
    *   Solutions of triangles calculation
    *   Speed, feed calculation
    *   Send/receive through serial port with automatic file saving and Serial port file server - possibility to download new CNC program directly from machine.
    *   Conversion inch/mm, mm/inch. You can write inches in format 1.3/4  1/4 ...
    *   Find in files
    *   Simple project management - you can keep links to (almost) all files related to your part program in one place. 
    *   First comment in program is displayed in title bar. In first comment you can write part name.
    *   Comment with date will be replaced with current date on file save. Comment format: (dd-/.mm-/.yyyy) or ;dd-/.mm-/.yyyy - now system localization settings are used.
    *   Block renumbering - whole program or selection
    *   Code colourizing. Now with help function - click on "Help"->"Create cnc tooltips" and put mouse pointer above G, M or other codes - should appear tooltip with short information about pointed code. 
                   Default tooltips are in file "cnc_tooltips_lang_code.txt" (lang_code = pl_PL - for Polish) in folder with application settings (~.config on Linux. C:\Documents and Settings\USERNAME\Application Data\EdytorNC on Windows).
		   You may copy it to folder with cnc programs and customize for your machine. File must be renamed to "cnc_tips.txt". Now this is done by functions in help menu.
		   Currently tooltip file contains some information about codes for OKUMA, SINUMERIK 850 and FANUC.
		   Code colourizing detects control type by 'in file' file name eg. : $EXAMPLE.MIN%  $SUBS.SSB% - OKUMA; :0110 O1234 - FANUC
